        <p>Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) is a university-based community
             group for students who are interested in technology, especially technology from Google. Google Developer Student Club is a 
            place to grow as a developer, starting from a beginner developer to 
            an advanced developer. It  is not always 
            about “programming” but also about connecting, learning together 
            and growing together. It as a community that becomes a "connection" forum for students who are 
            interested in technology from various majors and have different 
            backgrounds. GDSC also aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge for student developers. It provides students with the resources, 
            opportunities and experience necessary to be industry ready, all while still pursuing their degrees. GDSC is a place for learning together with people who 
            have the same interest in the field, which certainly makes the learning 
            process more interesting. We conduct events, seminars, hands-on-sessions 
            and hackathons to keep students engaged in these activities. Hence, we are here with GDSC-MVJCE that will benefit all the students willing to move a step ahead to better 
        themselves. One can join the teams of interest and upskill themselves in their respective fields.<br>
    Host workshops : Grow student knowledge on developer products and platforms through events and workshops.<br>
Build projects: Identify local partners to work with and lead project building activities.<br>
Professional growth: Access to community management training and technical knowledge invitations to selected Google events. </p>
